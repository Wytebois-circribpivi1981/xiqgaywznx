just saw O'Dessa... wow. like my brain's a blender set on high. still hear faint popcorn-munching echoes in my head, the smell too, butter clinging like a persistent ghost. back's sore - those theater seats, they're medieval torture devices in disguise. plot was... a kaleidoscope? a tornado not leaving a mess but painting a pic. wait, did i buy the ticket or sneak in? 

> soundtrack tho. like someone sewed together all my dreams and nightmares, and had an orchestra play it during a storm. noise of theater mixed with the melodies and dissonance. felt like being in a busy kitchen, pans flying. forgot to vet my emotions, they just poured out.

flashes of purples and oranges. lead actress's eyes!! like a mix of stars and coffee? or was it the guy next to me asleep, drooling in dreams of caffeine. every scene was like standing at the edge of cliff but never jumping off--the wind's a slap but you're glued to the ground. ya get me?

did they say I could download the movie later? someone asked, right? like, who'd want it? too chaotic... in a good way? watch the movie if your heart's wild enough and if you can find a spot in this theater that's not a squeaky chair.

sky turned upside down at one point, or was it just my eyes playin tricks?? popcorn crumbs all over... a mini-apocalypse in my lap. crumbs as stars, my hands a galaxy or just sticky.

Python thinks I'm crazy now. 

```python
def feelings_overflow():
    if mind == scattered:
        return heart_full of mixed_emotions
feeling = emotions(reel=dazed, dreams_shattered=True)
me.send_file(None)
```
